<FONT SIZE=+1><P>About this e-book</P></FONT>
<P>Every attempt has been made to render this e-book in the highest quality. Due to the nature of HTML, though, some characters may not display properly.</P>
<P>For example, it is not possible to extend a square root sign over a quantity.  In this case, the quantity under the square root sign is parenthesized, like this:
<BR>&#8730;(a + b)
<BR>This represents the quantity a + b under the square root sign:
<BR><PRE>
  _________
\/  a + b
</PRE>
<P>Planck's constant is represented by <I>&#295;</I>; if your browser does not interpret that correctly, it is an italicized <I>h</I> with a horizontal bar through it.
<P>In the notes, a vector is represented by a superscripted arrow following the letter:
<BR><I>x</I><SUP><SMALL>&#8594;</SMALL></SUP>
<BR>which represents:
<BR><PRE>
 ->
 x
</PRE>
<BR>The same goes for a tilde sign above a letter.
<P>Finally, the Greek letters alpha (&alpha;), Tau (&Tau;), pi (&pi;), Sigma (&Sigma;), and mu (&mu;) appear in the notes.</P>
<P>This is version 1.0; please post corrections as version 1.1 and update this file.</P>
